[Verse 1]
You leapt from crumbling bridges watching cityscapes turn to dust
Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above

[Chorus]
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye
[Verse 2]
Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms
You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark

[Chorus]
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye
